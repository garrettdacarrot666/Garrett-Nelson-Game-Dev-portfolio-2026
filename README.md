### Starbreaker: Endless Void

![SpaceGame](https://github.com/garrettdacarrot666/portfolio/blob/main/images/spacegame.png?raw=true)

Description:

In Starbreaker: Endless Void, you pilot a lone spaceship through an infinite asteroid field at the edge of the galaxy. Dodge incoming rocks, blast them to dust with your laser cannons, and collect power-ups to upgrade your turrets, restore health, and replenish ammo. Every second you survive, the asteroids come faster and hit harder—testing your reflexes, precision, and endurance. Rack up points, boost your accuracy, and see how long you can last before the void finally claims your ship.
